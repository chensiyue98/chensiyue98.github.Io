## Selected Projects

### Design and Implementation of Environmental Monitoring System Based on IoT

**Final Project**

* The existing management system for computer labs has insufficient measurement
factors. We design a system with the ability of sensing the environment and
maintain certain conditions automatically , while the conditions can be controlled
remotely.
* The system includes a sensing device based on STM32, an Android application to
monitor and control, and a back-end cloud platform for data processing.

### VR Haptic Wearable System

**Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program**

Leader

* Since current VR systems lack physical feedback, that reduces immersion, we
design a low-cost VR haptic solution, including force feedback and motion
capture.
* In charge of server and raspberry pie communication; responsible for developing
motion capture and character instant modeling system.

### Intelligent Parking Platform Based on Mechanical Parking System

**“Internet+” Innovation Competition**

Leader

* To solve the problem of parking difficulty and traffic stratification in mountainous
areas, we designed mechanical garage and the supporting intelligent parking
system, analyzed its profit model, and put forward the business plan.
* In charge of project framework construction, marketing analysis and APP
prototype.
